# Changelog

All notable changes to the Google Family Link Integration will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`pause_app` / `resume_app` services** - Pause apps for one child with a 1-minute daily limit instead of blocking them, and put back each app's earlier setting (limit, unlimited or none) afterwards. A paused app stays installed; a blocked Google Messages loses the texts that arrive while it is blocked, a paused one keeps them. The earlier settings are stored and survive restarts.

---

## [2.2.6] - 2026-10-08

Per-device entities follow what Google says each device can do, contributed by @theSiegs (#188).

### Fixed
- **A Google TV / Chromecast no longer gets a row of permanently unavailable entities and a lock switch that does nothing** (#173, #188, thanks to @theSiegs) - The integration created the full phone/tablet entity set for every supervised device, but Google only backs the time-limit entities (lock switch, ring and bonus buttons, bedtime/school-time/daily-limit sensors, screen-time remaining/next-restriction) for devices that enforce screen-time rules. A Google TV or Chromecast has no bedtime, daily limit or on-demand lock of its own — those are set and enforced on the TV itself — so on such a device every one of those entities stayed `unknown`/`unavailable` and its lock switch, ring and bonus buttons posted commands the device ignored. Each per-device entity is now created only when the device advertises the matching capability in Google's own per-device `capabilityInfo` (already fetched, previously unused); the daily-screen-time sensor, backed by app-activity reporting, is kept for any device. Existing installs have the now-unsupported entities removed from the registry on setup. When Google returns no capability list for a device (older cached data, or a response without it), every entity is created as before, so nothing is dropped on incomplete data. The device's capability list is exposed as an attribute of its daily-screen-time sensor so it is visible why an entity is or is not present.

---

## [2.2.5] - 2026-10-06

Two fixes owed to reporters: the reconfigure step on Supervisor installs, and a reset bonus button that really resets.

### Fixed
- **Reconfigure: "Clear API key" could never validate on a Supervisor install** (#186, spotted by @jeallen2) - The reconfigure step forced the manual endpoint source and validated with the key typed in the form, none when clearing, so the add-on answered 403 and the form said "invalid API key"; the only way out of a stale key was to paste the new one by hand. An add-on (managed) entry now stays managed as long as its URL is unchanged and no key is typed, and the validation reads the key the add-on shares, as the integration does at runtime. A typed key or another URL still makes the endpoint manual.
- **The reset bonus button cancels every bonus of the day** (discussion #142) - Bonuses stack on Google's side and the applied limits only report the most recent one, so cancelling that single id left the others running: four presses on +15 needed four presses on reset. The button now reads the override block, which keeps every override of the day, and cancels each bonus of the device; the single reported id remains the fallback when that block cannot be read.

---

## [2.2.4] - 2026-10-01

Two robustness corrections brought by reporters and contributors.

### Fixed
- **Weekly bedtime and school time writes failed with HTTP 400 on accounts whose slots are keyed by a UUID** (#183, thanks to @jeallen2 for the diagnosis) - The weekly slot matchers required a `CA*` protobuf id before looking at anything else, so on those accounts the day's slot was never found, the write fell back to the static day codes, and Google refused them. A row whose policy id (the revision id at index 7) is the bedtime or school time policy is now taken whatever its id looks like; the `CA*` prefix only gates the fallback that decodes the rule type from the id. A UUID row without a policy id is still not guessed at.
- **A failed family members read fails the refresh instead of returning no children** (#184, thanks to @modert) - A DNS timeout or a 5xx on that one request was logged as a warning and the refresh carried on with zero supervised children: at startup no entities were created until a manual reload, and later refreshes blanked every child's data. The refresh now keeps the last known data, or reports the entry as not ready at startup so Home Assistant retries the setup by itself.

---

## [2.2.3] - 2026-09-26

One robustness correction for strict mode, seen live the same evening.

### Fixed
- **A single failed read of the time limit rules made strict mode "correct" everything** - When Google answered an error (a 503 on 2026-09-26) to the time limit rules request, the client returned a default result, bedtime off and no schedule at all, that looked like a real answer. The coordinator never fell back to its cache, and strict mode read it as bedtime switched off, school time switched on and seven bedtime slots missing: nine corrections in 25 seconds, seven notifications, for nothing. The client now raises on such an answer, the coordinator uses its cache as designed, and strict mode skips a child whose rules or applied limits could not be read on that refresh: there is nothing to correct on that basis.

---

## [2.2.2] - 2026-09-25

One strict mode correction, seen live the same evening.

### Fixed
- **Strict mode fought a daily limit changed from Home Assistant** - Setting a weekday quota from the `number.<child>_<weekday>_limit` entity or the `set_daily_limit` action recorded the new value as the strict mode reference only once Google had confirmed it, and that confirmation takes several seconds per device. A refresh in between found the old reference, put the old quota back, the confirmation then failed, and the new value was never recorded: every attempt was undone within the same second, until strict mode happened to be in its cooldown. The value is now declared to strict mode before it is written, as a bonus already was, and put back to the previous reference only when Google took none of the writes.

---

## [2.2.1] - 2026-09-25

The device lock now keeps the always allowed apps reachable, the last piece of #175.

### Changed
- **A device lock from Home Assistant now keeps the always allowed apps reachable** (#175, thanks to @wojtulab) - The lock is written with Google's override code 7 instead of 1: the child still sees "Time for a break", but the lock screen offers an "Available apps" button to open the apps marked "always allowed" in Family Link, which is what the Family Link app itself does when its lock screen setting is on. Both codes were verified on a supervised tablet: with 1 the button is absent, with 7 it is there. A new option, *Device lock keeps the always allowed apps reachable*, on by default, brings back the plain lock (emergency calls only) when switched off. Strict mode relocks and the device switch follow the option.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-25

School time start and finish per weekday, contributed by @grifmo (#179), plus a targeting fix that came with it.

### Added
- **School time start and finish** (#179, thanks to @grifmo) - New `familylink.set_school_time` service that edits the weekly school time window of a weekday (`scope: weekly`, default), or posts a window for today only (`scope: today`) without touching the weekly schedule. New `time.<child>_<weekday>_school_time_start` / `_school_time_end` entities read the weekly school time schedule and write it back, like the bedtime ones. The weekly write reuses the `timeLimit:update` call of `set_bedtime`, pointed at the day's school time slot id (the row attached to the school time policy); the today write is the type-9 override `enable_school_time` already posts, with the chosen window instead of now → 23:59.

### Fixed
- **Services called with a child-level entity acted on the first child** - The child's bedtime, school time and daily limit switches carry no `child_id` attribute, so `enable_school_time`, `disable_school_time`, `enable_bedtime` and the other services given such an `entity_id` silently fell back to the first supervised child. The child is now taken from the Family Link device of the entity when the attribute is missing.

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-09-24

Two device switch corrections reported, with the fix, by @wojtulab.

### Fixed
- **The device switch ignored school time** (#176, thanks to @wojtulab) - During a school time window the switch stayed ON, its icon unchanged and `restriction_reason` never said `school_time_active`, although the `school_time_active` attribute was right; only bedtime and a reached daily limit turned it OFF. School time now counts like bedtime in the state, the icon (`mdi:school`) and the reason, and in strict mode's own usability reading. A running bonus still wins, as it does for bedtime.
- **A lock that keeps the allowed apps reachable was read as unlocked** (#175, thanks to @wojtulab) - When the "apps without time limit" lock screen setting is on in the Family Link app, Google writes the device lock with override code 7 instead of 1. The integration only knew 1, so such a lock showed as unlocked, and strict mode or a relock automation replaced it within seconds with a plain lock, taking the allowed-apps button away from the child. Code 7 is now read as locked. The switch gains a `lock_override_code` attribute (1 lock, 7 lock with allowed apps, 4 unlock, empty when none) so automations can tell the two locks apart. Writing a code 7 lock from Home Assistant is not offered yet.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-22

Screen time per device, and the services now check who is calling.

### Added
- **Screen time per device** (#174, thanks to @zupis) - A new `sensor.<device>_daily_screen_time` for every supervised device, in minutes, with the per-app breakdown of that device in its attributes and `unknown` while the data is missing. The child's `sensor.<child>_daily_screen_time` gains a `by_device` attribute keyed by device id (name, minutes, seconds, formatted time); its `apps` attribute keeps its shape. Google reports every usage session with the device it happened on (`deviceMudId`), verified on an account with a phone and a tablet.

### Security

- **The `familylink.*` services now check who is calling** (#177). Home Assistant evaluates entity permissions on entity actions (switches, buttons, numbers, times) but not on domain services, so the services that take a raw `child_id` or `device_id`, or no target at all, could be called by any authenticated user, administrator or not, including a supervised child who has a Home Assistant account (#169). From now on: a call from an automation is trusted as before; an administrator can do anything; a non-administrator may call a service with an `entity_id` they are allowed to control, exactly as if they had toggled it from a dashboard; everything else is refused with an Unauthorized error and a warning in the log. If a dashboard used by a non-administrator calls a service with a raw `device_id` or `child_id`, switch it to the matching `entity_id`.

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-09-15

Two strict mode corrections, both about corrective actions being fired when nothing needed correcting.

### Fixed
- **Strict mode: a bonus given from Home Assistant on a device locked from Home Assistant was fought at every refresh** - Posting a bonus lifts Google's lock override, so the device showed as unlocked while the lock decision of the day still stood: strict mode relocked it every 90 s, without effect while the bonus ran, one "device locked again" event each time. A bonus given from Home Assistant now suspends the relock for its duration; the lock is put back once the bonus is over.
- **Daily limit read as switched off for one refresh after a lock or unlock from Home Assistant** - During the five seconds the lock state is provisional after a lock or unlock, the refresh skipped the copy of the device's time data, so the child-level daily limit state read as off for that poll: the daily limit switch blinked off, and with strict mode on, a "daily limit switched off on Google's side" correction (and its event) fired after every lock or unlock made from Home Assistant, re-enabling a limit nobody had touched. The time data is now copied whatever the lock state.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-14

Two things change the nature of the integration: it can now impose the parent's settings on Google (strict mode), and it drives the app's weekly limits screen. Nothing changes for an existing installation until the Strict mode option is switched on. Read the **Strict mode** section of the README before enabling it: while it is on, manage Family Link from Home Assistant only, changes made in the app are undone. Cumulative release of the 2.0.0-rc1 (2026-09-07) and 2.0.0-rc2 (2026-09-11) pre-releases; the auth add-on stays at 1.9.0.

### Added
- **Weekly limits entities: the quota and the bedtime of each weekday, per child** - `number.<child>_<weekday>_limit` (seven per child) shows the weekly screen time quota of that weekday, as the weekly limits screen of the app does, and today's override when Google applies one. Setting it writes the weekly quota through the same `timeLimit:update` call as the app (captured live); today's entity also posts today's override so the change applies at once. `time.<child>_<weekday>_bedtime_start` and `_bedtime_end` (fourteen per child) read and rewrite the weekly bedtime slot of that weekday. The `set_daily_limit` action gets an optional `day` field (1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday) with the same behaviour. Verified live: a daily-limit override is only honoured by Google for the current day and, posted for another day, it cancels today's, so other weekdays never use it. With strict mode, the values rule keeps the seven weekly quotas as reference, writes back a weekday changed on the Google side and puts today's applied minutes back.
- **Strict mode: Home Assistant reverts restriction changes made from the Family Link side** - A supervised child who knows the Google interface can post a time bonus, unlock a device during bedtime or school time or with no time left, or switch bedtime and the daily limit off. Parents were reproducing the fix with a set of automations (cancel the bonus, re-lock, switch the policy back on). This is now native: with the **Strict mode** option on, the coordinator compares Google's state with the chosen rules after every refresh and reverts the difference: bonus cancelled, device lock put back to what Home Assistant decided (a Google-side unlock that bypasses an active restriction is locked again until the restriction ends), bedtime and daily limit switched back on. One `switch.<child>_strict_mode` per child pauses or resumes it (the option and the switches mirror each other: the option applies to every child at once, a switch toggle writes the option back), the rules are chosen in the options (all six by default: bonus, device lock, bedtime, daily limit, school time, and the values themselves, weekly bedtime hours and daily limit minutes; nothing is switched on by force, the state in force when strict mode starts is the reference and only Home Assistant changes it afterwards), what is changed from Home Assistant (switches, bonus buttons, actions) is the parent's decision and stays in force (policy references until Home Assistant changes them, device lock decisions for the day), remembered across restarts, each action is logged, kept in the switch attributes and fired as a `familylink_strict_mode_action` event, and an action is not repeated within 90 s. Changes Home Assistant itself just made are left alone while they propagate. Option and rule labels translated in English, French and Hebrew.
- **Strict mode option and switches mirror each other** - The Strict mode option of the integration is the state of every child's switch at each load and applies live when changed; toggling a switch writes the option back once every child agrees.
- **Entity ids of the new entities** - The weekday quota numbers, the bedtime times and the strict mode switch take their prefix from the child's device, so their ids read `number.<child>_<weekday>_limit` rather than repeating the child name. Existing entities are unchanged.

### Security
- **Authentication server credentials are no longer stored in URLs.** Manual setup now uses a separate masked API-key field; version-1 entries are migrated to a query-free URL and unique ID, runtime requests send only `X-API-Key`, and config-entry diagnostics redact the credential. The API-key field remains optional for standalone auth containers that do not set `API_KEY`; existing keys can be rotated or cleared through Reconfigure. This change raises the minimum Home Assistant version to 2024.4, when native reconfigure flows were introduced.

---

## [1.2.15] - 2026-09-07

Cumulative release of the 1.2.15 pre-releases (rc1 to rc4) and of the fixes prepared as 1.2.16. Last release of the 1.x line; the next one is 2.0.0 (strict mode and weekly limits).

### Security
- **Auth add-on 1.9.0: the browser view is no longer reachable with a known password.** The default VNC password `familylink` is gone; a random one is generated at every start when none is configured, and the web UI never carries it. See the add-on changelog and its new Security section (`familylink-playwright/DOCS.md`).

### Added
- **`set_update_interval` action (issue #156)** - An automation can now change the polling interval at runtime, for example every 10 minutes during bedtime and every minute during the day, to reduce the number of requests to Google when nothing is expected to change. The new interval applies immediately and lasts until the next reload or restart, after which the value from the integration options applies again; it is deliberately not written to the options. Requested by @beamer2k23.
- **Allowed calls and texts select entity (PR #150, by @mdo77)** - Each child gets `select.<child>_allowed_calls_texts` to choose who can call and text them: **Anyone**, **Only contacts I add** or **Contacts I add & limited groups**. The level is read from Google's `trustedcontacts` endpoint by the coordinator with the other per-child data (cache fallback and session-expiry handling included) and written back through `trustedcontacts:update`. An account where the setting was never touched reports level 0, shown as Anyone. Endpoint shape confirmed on a live capture.

### Fixed
- **Entities are created again on Home Assistant 2026.9 (issue #155, rc3 report)** - Home Assistant 2026.8 deprecated the `via_device` key of `DeviceInfo` in favour of `via_device_id`, and 2026.9 turns the deprecation report into an error when the calling frame cannot be attributed to an integration, which is the case for a `DeviceInfo` consumed by the entity platform: the first entity that created a device with `via_device` failed to be added (`Error adding entity None for domain binary_sensor`), so `binary_sensor.<device>_bedtime_active` was missing. Device entities now link to the child's hub device through `via_device_id` when the running Home Assistant supports it (2026.8 and later) and through `via_device` before that, and every platform makes sure the hub device exists before adding entities, whatever the platform load order. Reported by @lbschenkel on 2026.9.
- **Bedtime is now detected in the morning on accounts using Google's newer downtime model (issue #155, rc2 report)** - Window rows are keyed by the day their occurrence starts. In the morning, while last night's bedtime is still running, these accounts list yesterday's row (e.g. the Wednesday 19:30-08:30 row at 06:54 on Thursday) and not today's, so the today-only filter of the parser found no bedtime at all: `binary_sensor.<device>_bedtime_active` was off and the next-restriction sensor pointed at school time while the device was locked. Yesterday's row is now accepted when its window crosses midnight and has not ended yet, and a window that is running is never replaced by one that is not when several rows describe the same rule. Accounts that list today's row in the morning (the legacy model) are unchanged.
- **Bedtime and school time sensors no longer report a window as active when the policy is off (issue #155)** - With every limit switched off in Family Link, the switches were correctly off but `binary_sensor.<device>_bedtime_active` stayed on all evening and the next-restriction sensor pointed at the bedtime. `appliedTimeLimits` keeps listing the window rows, with their own state flag still set, after the bedtime or school time policy has been disabled; the per-device parser only looked at that flag. The coordinator now applies the same today-effective policy state the switches use to the device windows: when bedtime or school time is off for today, the corresponding window is dropped and the active flag is false. On accounts using the older downtime model this was masked by the classification bug fixed in v1.2.15-rc1, which filed the bedtime row under school time. Reported by @lbschenkel.
- **Next-restriction sensor no longer says "Bedtime (ends Active now)" all evening (issue #155)** - For a bedtime crossing midnight (e.g. 19:30-08:30) both ends of the window were dated today, so from 19:30 on the end was already in the past. The window is now anchored to its actual occurrence: in the evening it ends tomorrow, in the morning it started yesterday. The `bedtime_start` / `bedtime_end` attributes follow.
- **Bedtime and school time windows: classification now uses Google's own typing (issue #151, follow-up)** - v1.2.14 classified `appliedTimeLimits` window rows by their policy id, which was not enough: both reporters still saw `School time in Xh` for their bedtime. A live capture of the endpoint shows that every device block ends with a typed section, `[[window_row, 4, 1], [window_row, 4, 2]]`, where the last element is the window type (1 = bedtime, 2 = school time, the same codes as the `timeLimit` revisions). The parser now reads that section first and only then falls back to the policy id, the `CAEQ`/`CAMQ` key prefix and, last, the hours. The prefix was also demoted below the policy id, since it only encodes the slot's rule type rather than the policy the slot is attached to. The debug log prints the typed section and the evidence used for each row.
- **Bedtime schedule, weekly slot lookup and "today" override now work on accounts using Google's newer downtime model (issue #151)** - @lbschenkel's debug log showed the actual shape of the affected accounts: bedtime slots are keyed `CAMQ...` (the school time slot format, with an embedded slot UUID) while still being attached to the bedtime policy, and the policy ids are account-specific rather than the usual `487088e7...` / `579e5e01...`. Every reader that split rows by key prefix was therefore wrong on those accounts: the `timeLimit` parser reported "bedtime 0 schedules, school 14 schedules" (the 7 bedtime slots counted as school time), which emptied the bedtime schedule attribute, made `enable_bedtime` / `set_bedtime scope=today` fall back to the default 21:30-07:00 window instead of the configured one, and left `set_bedtime scope=weekly` unable to resolve the slot id. Window rows are now classified by the policy id at index `[7]`, matched against the revision ids parsed first, with the prefix as fallback only; the weekly slot resolver accepts rows attached to the bedtime revision; and a bedtime "today" override written in the `[weekday, rule_uuid]` shape (the school time shape) is honoured alongside the `CAEQxx` day-code shape, most recent wins.
- **`set_daily_limit` reported success while the sensors kept the old value (issue #157)** - On @jar87's second child the action returned success but the app, the device and the Home Assistant sensors kept showing the previous limit. The live capture showed why: Google keeps the recurring row (1380 min) in the device block of `appliedTimeLimits` next to the effective override (100 min), and the parser let the recurring copy, listed further down, overwrite the effective row. The parser now prefers the effective daily-limit row (front of the device block) over a recurring or historical copy. Two hardenings come with it, ported from the same patch: the slot id referenced by the override is read from the account's live `timeLimit` response instead of the static `CAEQxx` table (static code as fallback, sharing the cached fetch already used for bedtime slots), and the effective value is read back from `appliedTimeLimits` after 3 s and 8 s, as for time bonuses since #141, so an override that Google accepts (HTTP 200) without applying now fails the action with a clear error instead of a silent success. Diagnosis, patch and live capture by @jar87.
- **Next-restriction sensor now announces tomorrow's window instead of "No restrictions"** - Once today's bedtime and school time were over (from mid-afternoon on a typical schedule), `sensor.<device>_next_restriction` read `No restrictions` for the rest of the day, because it only looked at today's windows. It now falls back to the weekly schedule from tomorrow on, skipping policies that are switched off and days without a slot, and reads for example `Bedtime in 6h20` in the evening or `School time in 1d 16h` on a Saturday. The window used is exposed as `next_scheduled_type` / `next_scheduled_start` / `next_scheduled_end` attributes. Today's windows and the "daily limit about to be reached" warning keep precedence.
- **Daily limit and remaining time sensors no longer show stale numbers when the limit is off** - With the daily limit disabled, `sensor.<device>_daily_limit` kept showing the last value stored on the row ("1m" in the #155 report) and `sensor.<device>_screen_time_remaining` showed `0`. Both now report `unknown` in that state (the configured value stays available as the `configured_minutes` attribute of the daily limit sensor); a running bonus still shows its remaining minutes.
- **`ring_device` is now unregistered when the last config entry is unloaded** - It was the only action left behind after an unload, so it survived with a dead coordinator reference until the next restart.

---

## [1.2.14] - 2026-08-25

### Added
- **Time bonuses are now verified after creation (issue #141)** - Google acknowledges a bonus `timeLimitOverrides:batchCreate` with HTTP 200 even when the override never takes effect on the target device (reported on ChromeOS: the device unlocks but the Family Link app shows no active bonus and no countdown). The client now logs the batchCreate response body, then polls `appliedTimeLimits` (after 3s, then 5 more) to check the override is actually visible, logging a warning when it is not instead of reporting an unconditional success. Purely diagnostic: behavior is unchanged, but silent half-failures now leave a trace that makes reports like #141 diagnosable.

### Fixed
- **Bedtime and school time windows are no longer swapped on UUID-keyed accounts (issue #151)** - On accounts where Google keys the `appliedTimeLimits` window rows by a per-slot UUID instead of the usual `CAEQ`/`CAMQ` codes (the format first seen in #74), the parser classified the first window it met as bedtime and the next one as school time. Google does not guarantee that order, so when the school time row came first the two windows traded places: `binary_sensor.<device>_schooltime_active` turned on in the evening while `bedtime_active` stayed off, and the next-restriction sensor pointed at the wrong window. Rows are now classified by the policy id they carry at index `[7]`, which matches the bedtime and school time ids in the `timeLimit` revisions; only if that id is unknown does the parser fall back to the hours (a window crossing midnight or starting in the evening is bedtime). Reported by @lbschenkel, confirmed by @richard-dg (#149).
- **`set_daily_limit` now accepts a `child_id` on its own (issue #148)** - Calling the action with only `child_id` raised "device_id is required", even though the field is documented as an alternative to the entity selector. A `child_id` given without a device now applies the limit to every device of that child; the error message names both accepted targets. Reported by @richard-dg.
- **Time bonuses now work on ChromeOS devices (issue #141)** - A web-app capture provided by @digitalrealism showed that Google uses a different wire shape for ChromeOS bonuses: override type **6** with the duration in **milliseconds** at index `[10]`, where Android uses type 10 with seconds at index `[13]`. Sending the Android shape to a Chromebook returned HTTP 200 but the bonus never took effect: the device unlocked, yet the Family Link app showed no active bonus and no countdown. The client now picks the shape per device (ChromeOS device ids are ~91 characters against 44 for Android, the only observable discriminator), reads type-6 overrides back so the active-bonus sensor and the cancel button also work on Chromebooks, and falls back to the legacy shape with a warning if the new one is not applied.
- **Config flow "invalid API key" message no longer points at a file that does not exist** - The error string (all languages) told the user to look for the key in the auth container's `./data/api_key` file. Since add-on 1.7.1 no key is generated in standalone mode: the endpoint is only protected when the `API_KEY` environment variable is set explicitly, so the message now points at that variable's value.

---

## Add-on / auth container [1.8.1] - 2026-08-21

### Changed
- **Add-on installs now pull the prebuilt multi-arch image from GHCR instead of compiling locally.** `config.json` declares `image: ghcr.io/noiwid/familylink-auth` and CI tags the published image with the add-on version, so installing or updating the add-on downloads in seconds instead of building Chromium and Playwright on the Home Assistant machine. Local builds remain available as a fallback.

---

## [1.2.13] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- **School time switch no longer springs back ON after being turned off (issue #140).** Turning school time off in Home Assistant posted a correct `action=1` daily override, but nothing ever read it back, so the next refresh returned the switch to ON and it looked like Home Assistant and the Family Link app had drifted apart. The today-effective override resolution added for bedtime in #113 could not cover school time: both override types share `item[2] == 9`, but bedtime ends with a `CAEQxx` day-code **string** while school time carries a `[weekday, rule_uuid]` **list**, so the bedtime reader's `startswith("CAEQ")` filter structurally never matched one. `async_get_time_limit` now resolves school time overrides through a dedicated parser (most recent by timestamp wins, since Google appends rather than replaces) and returns `school_time_enabled_today`, which the coordinator prefers over the `appliedTimeLimits` value, exactly mirroring the bedtime path. Reported by @Piepke82 (#140).
- **School time no longer appears to "turn itself on" at the start of the school window (issue #140).** `appliedTimeLimits` sets its school time flag as soon as a window exists for today, which means *"a school time window is **scheduled** today"*, not *"school time is enabled"*. Used alone it flipped the switch to ON at the window's start hour regardless of any override. That value is now kept separately as `school_time_scheduled_today` and no longer decides the switch state on its own.

### Added
- **Diagnostic attributes on the school time switch (issue #140).** The switch now exposes `school_time_enabled_weekly` (the weekly policy toggle) and `school_time_scheduled_today` (whether today has a school time window at all) alongside its own today-effective state. A "today only" override legitimately makes these disagree, since the weekly toggle in the Family Link app stays ON when only today is turned off, so showing the three together makes an apparent desync self-explanatory instead of looking like a bug.

### Changed
- **Failure to read existing school time overrides is now logged as a warning.** `_async_list_schooltime_overrides_today` previously swallowed fetch failures at DEBUG level and returned an empty list, silently skipping the DELETE-before-CREATE cleanup and allowing stacked, conflicting overrides to accumulate on the same day. The fetch/unwrap step is now shared with the state reader (`_async_fetch_time_limit_data`) and logs at WARNING when it cannot read them.

---

## Add-on / auth container [1.8.0] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **noVNC no longer hangs on "Connecting…" forever (issue #136).** The auth container's display stack (Xvfb + fluxbox + x11vnc + websockify) was started with all output redirected to `/dev/null` and no real liveness check, so any failure was completely silent: the container stayed "healthy" on uvicorn/8099 while noVNC never rendered. Two concrete failure modes are addressed, plus the underlying crash:
  - **Silent failures are now visible.** In the standalone container each display process logs to `/var/log/familylink/<proc>.log` instead of `/dev/null`, and its status is re-checked after launch with the last log lines dumped on failure. The add-on entrypoint (already logging to journald) gains the same Xvfb/fluxbox/x11vnc liveness checks.
  - **Stale X99 state is cleaned on start.** A non-graceful stop (e.g. `docker restart`) left `/tmp/.X11-unix/X99` and `/tmp/.X99-lock` behind, which made `Xvfb :99` silently refuse to bind on the next start and took the whole display stack down invisibly — only uvicorn came back, so the container reported healthy while VNC was dead. Both are now removed before the display server starts (and again before the x11vnc fallback).
  - **VNC password length.** x11vnc's `-passwd` (and TigerVNC's VncAuth) uses DES and silently keeps only the first 8 characters, so the 10-char default (`familylink`) never authenticated cleanly. The password is now truncated explicitly with a warning, and the web UI's auto-connect URL embeds the same 8-char value so client and server agree. The server stays localhost-only behind websockify.

### Changed
- **TigerVNC is now the default display backend, with automatic fallback to Xvfb + x11vnc (issue #136).** The primary crash (`x11vnc` 0.9.16 tearing down its own X connection the instant a VNC client connects, confirmed by @wookash via `strace`) is most likely an incompatibility between the 2019 x11vnc build and the bookworm X11 libraries. Rather than chase a compatible x11vnc, the container now prefers **TigerVNC's `Xvnc`** — an X server that speaks the RFB/VNC protocol natively, so there is no separate Xvfb and no x11vnc screen-scraper, removing the exact component that crashed. If `Xvnc` is unavailable or fails to start, the container automatically falls back to the legacy Xvfb + x11vnc stack, so no environment loses VNC. The backend can be forced with `FAMILYLINK_VNC_BACKEND=tigervnc|x11vnc`.

## [1.2.12] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **`set_bedtime` with `scope: weekly` no longer fails with HTTP 400 on some accounts** — The weekly write sent a hardcoded slot id from `_DAY_CODES` (`CAEQAQ`…`CAEQBw`). Those ids are account-specific, so on accounts whose bedtime slots use different ids Google rejected every weekly call with `HTTP 400 [3,"Request contains an invalid argument."]` — 7 failures per full-week sync. The client now resolves the slot id from the live schedule (`people/{id}/timeLimit`) before building the payload, falling back to the static codes only when the lookup fails. Reported, diagnosed and patch-validated by @bedar89 (#135).

  A live capture corrected one detail of the original diagnosis: `CAEQ*` and `CAM*` are not two account-specific families where an account has one or the other — they **coexist in the same account, in the same list**. Decoding the protobuf, field 1 is the rule type: **1 = bedtime** (`CAEQ*`), **3 = school time** (`CAMQ*`, with an embedded UUID). A third block reuses the bedtime ids but carries minutes instead of a window — that one is the daily limit. So resolving "the first `CA*` id matching the day" is order-dependent and can put a school-time id in a bedtime payload, turning a loud 400 into a silent wrong-schedule write. A row is now accepted only when the id decodes to rule type 1 **and** the row carries an `[h, m]`–`[h, m]` window, which is immune to row ordering and to the response nesting shifting between API versions. The fetched schedule is cached per account for 60s, since writing a full week is one call per day.

### Changed
- **Schedule parsing extracted into `schedules.py`** — The positional-array parsing that breaks when Google shifts an index was the least testable code in `client/api.py` (reaching it required an authenticated client and a live account). Adapted from the split-out module in [@benkap's fork](https://github.com/benkap/HAFamilyLink). The extracted parsers are stricter than the hand-rolled loop they replace: they reject booleans where an integer day is expected (`isinstance(True, int)` is `True` in Python, so a stray bool passed as Monday), validate the window shape and hour/minute ranges, sort rows by day instead of trusting response order, and surface `enabled` / `state_flag` / `day_name` which the old loop silently dropped. Verified to return byte-identical `day`/`start`/`end` slots to the old parser on a live response, so existing entities are unaffected.

---

## [1.2.11] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **GPS location tracking restored after a Google API change** — Google's `kidsmanagement` location endpoint stopped accepting the string values `"REFRESH"` / `"DO_NOT_REFRESH"` for `locationRefreshMode` and now returns `HTTP 400: Invalid value at 'location_refresh_mode' … "REFRESH"`. Because `async_get_location` returns `None` on any non-200 response, an active location refresh silently froze on the last known position with no error surfaced to the user. The client now sends the numeric enum values (`2` = REFRESH, `1` = DO_NOT_REFRESH). Verified against the live API: the string `"REFRESH"` returns HTTP 400 while `"1"`/`"2"` return HTTP 200 with a fresh fix. Thanks to @miditt (#132).
- **Removed `aiohttp` and `cryptography` from manifest requirements** — Both are already bundled with Home Assistant. Declaring them caused HA to reinstall `cryptography`/`cffi` over the core versions, producing a `cffi` / `_cffi_backend` version mismatch (`this is the 'cffi' package version 2.1.0 … we get version 2.0.0`) that broke several core components on HA 2026.7.1 (Python 3.14). Per the HA docs, custom integrations must not list requirements already included with HA. Thanks to @omad (#131).

### Added
- **Example dashboard** — Added an `examples/` folder with a ready-to-copy, Family-Link-only Lovelace dashboard (anonymised entity IDs, `sections` layout), a screenshot, and setup notes (required HACS cards + theme). Referenced from the README.

---

## [1.2.10] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- **`set_bedtime` now updates the recurring weekly schedule (not just a one-off override)** — The service previously posted only a per-day type-9 override (`timeLimitOverrides:batchCreate`), i.e. Family Link's "tonight only" exception. It reported success but the recurring **weekly** schedule shown in Family Link ("Weekly schedule") was never touched, so the change silently didn't stick. `set_bedtime` now defaults to editing the weekly recurring schedule for the target day via `timeLimit:update` (only the modified day is sent; Google merges it, leaving other days untouched — verified on-device). A new `scope` option preserves the old behavior: `scope: weekly` (default) edits the weekly schedule, `scope: today` posts the one-off "today only" override without changing the weekly schedule (#129).
- **Removed deprecated `TrackerEntity` import** — `device_tracker.py` imported `TrackerEntity` from `homeassistant.components.device_tracker.config_entry`, a deprecated alias scheduled for removal in HA Core 2027.6. Now imported from `homeassistant.components.device_tracker` (#130).

---

## [1.2.7-rc5] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Cache last known data on transient API errors (503/500/timeouts)** — Google's Family Link API (especially `appsandusage`) regularly returns transient 5xx errors, which previously dropped every sensor to `unavailable` even though the underlying data was unchanged. The coordinator now keeps the last successful fetch in memory and returns it on transient errors, with per-child fallbacks for each endpoint (apps/usage, time limit config, applied limits, screen time). `SessionExpiredError` still propagates so re-authentication is unaffected; the cache is cleared on restart. Thanks to @Naumsede for the contribution (#117).

---

## [1.2.7-rc4] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Bedtime/school time schedules are now actually parsed (0 schedules → real windows)** — The rc3 index fix (`item[3]`/`item[4]`) was correct but lived inside a loop that never ran: the parser expected `data[0][0]` to be a *list* of schedule rows, but the real Family Link `timeLimit` response has `data[0] = [stateFlag, [<flat list of schedule items>], ts, ts, 1]` — `data[0][0]` is the integer stateFlag, so the `isinstance(data[0][0], list)` guard was always False and both schedule lists came back empty. Confirmed against the live (un-anonymized) API response: every fetch logged `0 schedules` and the bedtime override always fell back to the hardcoded `21:30→07:00` default. Now reads the flat schedule list at `data[0][1]` and splits it by code prefix (`CAEQ*` = bedtime, `CAMQ*` = school time). Today's real bedtime window is now used for the override (#113).
- **School time schedule windows recovered** — The old school-time branch read `data[1][0][2]`, which holds daily-limit *minutes* (`[code, day, stateFlag, minutes, …]`), not `CAMQ` time windows — so it never matched. School time windows live in the same flat list as bedtime (`data[0][1]`) and are now parsed from there.

---

## [1.2.7-rc3] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **Bedtime override now uses today's actual schedule instead of hardcoded 21:30–07:00** — The CAEQ (bedtime) and CAMQ (school time) schedule parsers read start/end from the wrong array indices, skipping the `stateFlag` at index 2. Start was read as the stateFlag integer (always failing the `isinstance(list)` check) and end was read as the actual start time. Both fell through to the hardcoded defaults `[21, 30]→[7, 0]`. Fixed to read `item[3]` (start) and `item[4]` (end), matching the documented protobuf layout (#113)

---

## [1.2.7-rc2] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **Bedtime switch now actually reaches the child device** — Same fix pattern as v1.2.7 for school time, applied to bedtime (#113). `switch.<child>_bedtime` and `familylink.enable_bedtime` / `familylink.disable_bedtime` now do both calls the Family Link web app sends when the user confirms "Apply changes to today as well?": (1) flip the weekly policy via `timeLimit:update`, (2) post a per-day override via `timeLimitOverrides:batchCreate` (action=2 to enable, action=1 to disable) using today's weekly bedtime hours and the matching `CAEQxx` day_code. The previous behavior only did step 1, which left tonight's slot unchanged on the device.
- **Bedtime and school time switches now reflect the effective today state** — `is_on` for both switches now reads `bedtime_enabled_today` / `school_time_enabled_today` from `appliedTimeLimits`, which combines the weekly policy with daily overrides. Previously the switches only read the weekly revisions, so after a "today only" override the switch would snap back to its weekly value on the next coordinator refresh (~30-60s) and the user would think the toggle did nothing (#114).

### Documentation
- `GOOGLE_FAMILY_LINK_API_ANALYSIS.md` — added a "Bedtime daily override pattern" section, updated the endpoints table to flag the bedtime weekly-only toggle as misleading (same trap as school time), and added an "Apply bedtime today" entry documenting the reverse-engineered payload (uses `CAEQxx` day_code instead of school time's `[weekday, rule_uuid]` tuple).

---

## [1.2.7] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **School time switch now actually locks/unlocks the child device** — Previously, `switch.<child>_school_time` and the `familylink.enable_school_time` / `familylink.disable_school_time` services only flipped the weekly policy via `timeLimit:update`. If the current weekday had no slot in the weekly schedule (e.g. weekends with a Mon-Fri schedule), nothing happened on the device. The integration now mirrors what the official Family Link web app does when toggling the "Today" switch: it posts a daily override via `timeLimitOverrides:batchCreate` (action=2 to enable, action=1 to disable) covering "now → 23:59" for today's weekday. Turning the switch off also cleans up any existing schooltime override for today to avoid stacking conflicting entries (#111)

### Documentation
- `GOOGLE_FAMILY_LINK_API_ANALYSIS.md` — added a dedicated "School time daily override pattern" section documenting the reverse-engineered `timeLimitOverrides:batchCreate` payload shape (`type=9` + `[weekday, rule_uuid]` reference) and the DELETE → CREATE sequence the web app uses

---

## [1.2.6-rc2] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **Config flow now exposes "Manual URL configuration" explicitly** — Previously the manual URL form was only reachable when local auto-detection failed, which made it impossible for Docker standalone users to point the integration at a remote auth container if `/share/familylink/` happened to contain stale data from a previous add-on install (#109)
- **Standalone container no longer shows a black noVNC screen** — A welcome banner is now displayed on the Xvfb display via `xterm` so users connecting to noVNC before triggering the auth flow get clear instructions instead of an empty desktop (#108)

### Changed
- `DOCKER_STANDALONE.md` rewritten to document the actual flow (open port 8099 first, then noVNC on port 6080) and the new menu option

---

## [1.2.2] - 2025-03-16

### Fixed
- **Revert `locationRefreshMode` to string values** — v1.2.1 incorrectly changed `locationRefreshMode` from string (`"REFRESH"` / `"DO_NOT_REFRESH"`) to numeric (`1` / `0`), which broke location tracking and battery level for all users. Reverted to the original string values expected by the Google Kids Management API (#89)

---

## [1.2.1] - 2025-03-15

### Fixed
- **`refresh_location` service returning HTTP 400** — *(Reverted in v1.2.2)* Changed `locationRefreshMode` to numeric values, which turned out to be incorrect (#84)

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-03

### Added
- **noVNC web-based browser access** — No external VNC client needed anymore! The authentication browser is now accessible directly from your web browser at `http://[HOST]:6080/vnc.html` (replaces raw VNC on port 5900)
- **Auto-detection of language and timezone** — The add-on now automatically reads your Home Assistant language and timezone settings via the Supervisor API. Manual override is still available in add-on configuration
- **Bilingual web UI (FR/EN)** — The add-on authentication interface now supports French and English, switching automatically based on your HA language setting
- **DNS configuration for Pi-hole compatibility** — Docker standalone setup now includes Google DNS (8.8.8.8) to avoid DNS resolution issues behind Pi-hole

### Changed
- VNC server (x11vnc) now restricted to localhost only — external access is exclusively via noVNC (port 6080)
- Add-on version bumped to 1.6.0
- Default language/timezone options are now empty (auto-detected from HA)

### Credits
- noVNC integration inspired by [@jnctech's fork](https://github.com/jnctech/HAFamilyLink)

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01 🎉

### Added
- **Per-app daily time limits** - New `set_app_daily_limit` service (#59)
  - Set daily time limits for specific apps (e.g., 60 minutes for TikTok)
  - Use `minutes: 0` to remove the limit and restore unlimited access
  - Supports targeting specific children via `entity_id` or `child_id`
  - When no child specified, applies to ALL supervised children

- **Multi-child support for app control services** (#57)
  - `block_app` and `unblock_app` now apply to ALL children when no `child_id` specified
  - Added optional `entity_id` parameter for easier child selection via UI

---

## [0.9.8] - 2025-01

### Added
- **Battery Level Sensor** - New `sensor.<child>_battery_level` entity (#54)
  - Displays battery percentage of the device providing location data
  - Dynamic icon based on battery level (full → alert)
  - Attributes: `source_device`, `last_update`
  - Also available as `battery_level` attribute on device tracker entity

### Important Limitations
- **Requires location tracking**: Battery data comes from the location API endpoint
- **One device per child**: Battery level corresponds to the device selected for location tracking in Family Link app (see "Change device" screen), not all devices
- **Charging state**: The API returns what appears to be a charging state value, but it has not been confirmed yet and is disabled until validated

---

## [0.9.7] - 2025-12

### Fixed
- **Regional Google domain cookie prioritization** - Fixed authentication for users with regional Google accounts (#48)
  - Users in Australia, UK, etc. may have SAPISID cookies from both `.google.com` and regional domains (e.g., `.google.com.au`)
  - The integration now correctly prioritizes `.google.com` cookies for SAPISIDHASH generation
  - Also applies to cookie header building, ensuring API compatibility

---

## [0.9.6] - 2025-12

### Added
- **`set_bedtime` service** - Set bedtime start/end times for a specific day (#46)
  - Parameters: `start_time`, `end_time`, `day` (optional, defaults to today), `child_id`
  - UI provides time pickers and dropdown for day selection
  - Example: Set bedtime to 20:45-07:30 for today or any specific day

### Fixed
- **Authentication loop fix** - Resolved issue where integration would continuously prompt for re-authentication (#48)
  - Root cause: Cookie cache (`_cookie_dict`, `_cookie_header`) was not invalidated on session refresh
  - The retry mechanism now properly reloads fresh cookies from the addon
- **SAPISID domain validation** - Now accepts regional Google domains (`.google.com.au`, `.google.co.uk`, etc.)
- **`set_daily_limit` now accepts 0 minutes** - Allows disabling device for the day without fully locking it (#47)
  - Useful for keeping unrestricted apps accessible while blocking screen time

---

## [0.9.5] - 2025-11

### Fixed
- **Bedtime/School Time toggle** - Now uses dynamic rule IDs instead of hardcoded UUIDs (#44)
  - Previously, enable/disable bedtime and school time failed with "invalid argument" error

- Standalone Docker bashio errors (#28)

### Security
- Added warning: never expose port 8099 to internet (cookies returned in plain JSON)
- GPS tracking opt-in by default (each poll may notify child's device)

---

## [0.9.3] - 2025-11-24

### Fixed
- `set_daily_limit` service now uses dynamic day code based on current day
- Previously hardcoded to Saturday (CAEQBg), causing changes to not apply on other days
