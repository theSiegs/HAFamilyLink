"""Pause and resume apps by their Family Link app time limit.

Pausing sets an app's daily limit to 1 minute. Measured live on Android 15:
an app whose limit is at or below the minutes it has already been used today
is paused within seconds, and stays installed. That is different from
blocking it (``block_app``), which hides the app, and for the default SMS app
(Google Messages) lost every text that arrived while it was blocked; a paused
Messages kept them. An app not used yet today gets its 1 minute, then pauses.

The setting in force before the first pause (a limit, unlimited time, or no
limit) is stored and put back by ``resume_app``, also after a restart. Limits
count per device, so a pause applies on every device of the child. Google TV
ignores app limits; there, only ``block_app`` works.

``resume_app`` compares before it restores: it reads the app's current setting
from Google and puts the saved one back only while the app is still at the
pause value. A setting a parent changed in the Family Link app since the pause
(a new limit, unlimited time, no limit) is kept and the saved one is dropped,
so a resume never overwrites a parent's decision. When the current settings
cannot be read, the saved setting is restored as before and a warning logged:
leaving the app paused would be the worse failure. An app blocked while it is
paused is left blocked: ``resume_app`` skips it and keeps its saved setting for
a later resume. A pause of an app whose earlier pause a parent already
replaced records the parent's setting as the one to come back to.

The saved settings are mirrored on ``coordinator.paused_apps`` so the apps
with time limits sensor can show which apps this integration paused.

The saved settings are one record shared by every child and changed across
network writes, so the two services run one at a time.
