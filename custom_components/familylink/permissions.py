"""Authorization of the familylink.* services.

Home Assistant evaluates a user's entity permissions only on service calls
that go through the entity platform machinery (toggling a switch, pressing a
button). The services registered by this integration take a raw ``child_id``
or ``device_id``, or no target at all (meaning every supervised child), so
without a check of our own any authenticated user, administrator or not,
could grant a bonus, lift a bedtime or unlock a device through the API. That
is the wrong default for a household where the supervised child may well have
a Home Assistant account (issue #169).

The rule mirrors what Home Assistant already does for the entities:

- a call without a user (automation, script started by the system) is trusted;
- an administrator can do anything;
- a call that names an ``entity_id`` and nothing else is allowed when the user
  may control that entity, exactly as if they had toggled it from a dashboard,
  so an entity permission policy applies to the services too;
- a call that relies on raw identifiers, or that has no target at all, needs an
  administrator, because there is no entity to evaluate a policy against.

A non-administrator may not combine an ``entity_id`` with a raw identifier:
the handlers let the raw value win over the one read from the entity, which
would otherwise turn a permitted entity into a key for any other device.
